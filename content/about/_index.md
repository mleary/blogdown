title: About me
---

I am a data scientist working in the insurance industry, proud father of an awesome
tiny human, and an avid Tottenham Hotspur fan[^1]. 


I enjoy working with data to solve business problems and build tools that help
people work more efficiently. The best part of working in data science is the 
oppurtunity to continuosly learn as new projects and problems arise.  In previous 
roles I worked on policy issues for a government agency and served nine years in 
the Army working in public affairs.


For more information on me you can check out my

the pagedown package in R.  

Also, here is a photo of my daughter, just because she is awesome and adorable.
