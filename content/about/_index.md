title: About me
---

I am a data scientist working in the insurance industry, proud father, and avid
Tottenham Hotspur fan.  COYs | TTID!


I enjoy working with data to solve business problems and build tools that help
people work more efficiently.  Data science requires constant learning of technical
methods, communication and presentation skills, and business requirements, 
and I find that exciting.

In previous roles I worked on policy issues for a state agency and served nine
years in the Army working in public affairs.
