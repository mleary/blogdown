As I look back on my blog, I can see that I have written two blog posts in the past year.  Clearly, I am nailing this blog thing.  Wanting to pad my stats to at least one post every three months (that is good, right?), I realized I could include some of my work solving Riddlers. Moving forward, I'll be moving over some of my past work and/or solving new Riddlers.

For those unfamiliar, [fivethirtyeight](fivethirtyeight.com) produces a regular puzzle challenge called THe Riddler.  While many can be solved with basic math and logic, I've used these as oppurtunities to practice/improve my coding in R and Python.
