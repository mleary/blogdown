```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE,
                      warning  = FALSE,

library(tidyverse)

```

The [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org) is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science.   I am a regular user of the `tidyverse`, and that means I know two things. First, almost any data manipulation, data visualization, or data modeling problem can be solved with the `tidyverse`.  Second, I regularly have to search Google or StackOverflow to remember which package to use or the parameters of a given function.

This post is a place for me to log my own tips for the `tidyverse` features and functions I use regularly. This way I can come to this page and CTRL + F to remind myself how to use them.

### <a id="getting_data"></a>Getting Data

* `readr` package
  * many useful functions for getting data, such as read_csv or read_file


### <a id="data_cleaning"></a>Data Cleaning

* Append column names with  with `dplyr::rename`
```{r}
data.frame(col1 = 1, col2 = 2, col3 =3) %>% 
  dplyr::rename_all(function(x) paste("prefix_", x))
```
*notice `rename_at` below, versus `rename_all` above*
```{r}
data.frame(col1_ignore = 1, col2_ending = 2, col3_ending =3) %>% 
  dplyr::rename_at(vars(tidyr::ends_with("ending")), function(x) paste("prefix_", x))
```

### <a id="data_manipulation"></a>Data Manipulation

* `forcats::fct_infreq()`
  * I love the `forcats` package.  There, I've said it. But this function relevels a factor based on the count of observations.  Very helpful when setting the factor levels for dummy variables or plotting charts (where you want the bars to be order from highest to lowest, for example.)  
  
* `tidyr::seperate()` & `tidyr::unite()`
  * combine two columns into one or split a column into two.


* `tidyr::full_seq()`
  * fills in missing data of a sequence, such as values by date where certain days have no values (i.e. NULL or NA)
  

### <a id="data_vis"></a>Data Vis

In this section I am including things that help make data pretty for tables or output, not just graphs and more standard visualizations.

* `janitor::adorn_*`
  * the `janitor` package also rocks much like the `forcats` package. I've used the `tabyl` function for quite some time, but I just found out i t has a series of functions that help round, create percents, etc., Example below.
  
```{r}
data.frame(row = c(1,2), x = c(1,3), y = c(1,4)) %>% 
  janitor::adorn_percentages("col") %>% 
  janitor::adorn_pct_formatting()

```
  
```{r}
data.frame(x = 1.227, y = 2.375) %>% 
  janitor::adorn_rounding(digits = 0, skip_first_col = FALSE)
```

### <a id="building_models"></a>Building models

* [Julia Silge blogpost](https://juliasilge.com/blog/tuition-resampling) on `tidymodels` package
  * Great, concise example of using `tidymodels`
