```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE,
                      warning  = FALSE,
                      message  = FALSE)

library(tidyverse)

```

The [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org) is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science.   I am a regular user of the `tidyverse`, and that means I know two things. First, almost any data manipulation, data visualization, or data modeling problem can be solved with the `tidyverse`.  Second, I regularly have to search Google or StackOverflow to remember which package to use or the parameters of a given function.

This post is a place for me to log my own tips for the `tidyverse` features and functions I use regularly. This way I can come to this page and CTRL + F to remind myself how to use them.

* `tidyr::full_seq()`
  * fills in missing data of a sequence, such as values by date where certain days have no values (i.e. NULL or NA)


### <a id="data_manipulation"></a>Data Manipulation

* `forcats::fct_infreq()`
  * I love the `forcats` package.  There, I've said it. But this function relevels a factor based on the count of observations.  Very helpful when setting the factor levels for dummy variables or plotting charts (where you want the bars to be order from highest to lowest, for example.)
