summary: With my team's use of Trello to track and monitor our workflow, I wanted to explore ways to capture that data via an API.  Without fail, there was an R package built by Jakub Chromec for that very purposes.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)

```


My work transitioned to an agile format and we've used Trello to track and monitor our sprints.
