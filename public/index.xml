      <description>Yihui Xie &amp;amp; Romain Lesur’s pagedown package allows users to create paged HTML documents that can be easily printed as PDFs. This includes RMarkdown templates that let you create letters, business cards, and most importantly resumes. I previously explored using pagedown for my resume and was impressed with the unique look it provided. That said, I never actually finished my exploration and I recently wanted to go back to pagedown and create a new resume.</description>

      <description>Why I wanted to Access Trello dataMy work transitioned to an agile format and we’ve used Trello to track and monitor our sprints. Our scrum master was tracking our hoursby looking at our Trello sprint board and manually updating a spreadshhet. Since we are constantly updating our sprint board, I thought I would look at ways to automate that process for him.
As expected, someone had already built an R package for accessing data from Trello via the Trello API.</description>

      <description>The 2018-2019 Premier League season has officially come to a close. While Manchester City and Liverpool battled for the top two positions, the race to secure Champions League football by finishing in 3rd and 4th place was up for grabs. Chelsea, Tottenham, Arsenal and Manchester United all had oppurtunites to move into the top four , but all four teams have struggled in form. In the end, Chelsea and Tottenham finsihed in 3rd and 4th, but it was certainly far from certain for both team.</description>
